Brief description of data used:

- 'features.txt': List of all features
   List of variable names for the data

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set. 
  Contains records for training data

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
Contains records for test data

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
Contains activity code labels for training data

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
Contains activity code labels for test data

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
  Contains activity labels to activity names mapping

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30

- 'train/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30

Following information is available for each record:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Steps involved in data processing:

Step 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Dataset "data" is created by merging X_train and X_test using rbind()
Corresponding feature names have been added from "features" data
Similarly, combined "subject" and "activity" datasets have been created by combining train and test data of subject(subject_train,subject_test) and activity (y_train,t_text) respectively

Step 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Identify the positions of features which correspond to mean and standard deviation of measurements and subset the data to include only those columns which correspond to these features

Step 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Replace the activity labels in the data with corresponding activity names. This mapping is available in the "activity_labels" dataset

Create consolidated dataset
Combine "subject","activity" and "data" (main data) to create a consolidated dataset using cbind()

Step 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
Make changes to the variable names to make them more meaningful and descriptive (using gsub())

Step 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
This step uses the reshape2 package
Use the melt and dcast functions to create a new final dataset with the average of each variable for each subject-activity combination
